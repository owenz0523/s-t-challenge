1. based off of the data json file and information text I have provided you as guidelines, what do you think of this project from a product perspective? pretend you are a product manager presented with facilitating this design

2.  this is my product design document so far, can you convert this to a prompt I can use to create a UX/initial prototype? pretend you are giving this to a UX designer, they need to know all the relevant information.

3. given this design prompt, create a design

4. use the information from the product design to create a step by step to build out this product. I will be feeding these steps into a coding agent so think of it like you were presenting this to a software engineer
